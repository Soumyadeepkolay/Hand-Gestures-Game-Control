# Hand-Gestures-Game-Control
Control your favorite PC games using hand gestures with this Python-based vision project!  
This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect hand movements through your webcam and map them to keyboard or mouse inputs — turning your camera into a real-time game controller.

# 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Control games using your hand gestures.
- 🖐️ Real-time hand and finger tracking using **MediaPipe Hands**.
- 🧠 Simple, customizable gesture-to-action mapping.
- 💻 Works with most PC games or applications.
- 🧩 Modular and easy to extend with new gestures.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries Used:
  - `OpenCV` — for camera and image processing.
  - `MediaPipe` — for hand landmarks and gesture detection.
  - `PyAutoGUI` or `Pynput` — for simulating keyboard/mouse inputs.
  - `Numpy` — for mathematical operations.

# ⚙️ Installation

1.⁠ ⁠*Clone this repository:*
   git clone https://github.com/Soumyadeepkolay/HandGestureGameControl.git
   cd HandGestureGameControl
2.	Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Run the program:
    python main.py

📸 How It Works
	1.	Opens webcam feed using OpenCV.
	2.	Detects hand landmarks via MediaPipe.
	3.	Interprets finger positions into gestures.
	4.	Maps recognized gestures to keyboard/mouse inputs for controlling a game.

🧠 Future Improvements
	•	Add multiple hand support.
	•	Integrate gesture customization via GUI.
	•	Improve accuracy with gesture classification models.
	•	Add FPS optimization for smoother control.
